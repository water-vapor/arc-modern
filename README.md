## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This application is configured for easy deployment to GitHub Pages. You can deploy it in two ways:

#### Automatic Deployment (GitHub Actions)

1. Fork or push this repository to your GitHub account
2. Ensure the repository name is updated in `vue.config.js`:
   ```js
   publicPath: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
     ? '/arc-modern/'  // Replace with your repository name if different
     : '/'
   ```
3. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
4. Push to the main branch, and the GitHub Action will automatically build and deploy the site
